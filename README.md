    <span style="font-size: 30px;">ImpRA: Impulse Response Analyzer</span>
</p>

## 🔍 Overview
This software enables the characterization of room impulse responses through a fast algorithm for calculating acoustic parameters. It supports the analysis of both mono and stereo signals. Additionally, users can visualize the energy curve and a table displaying the results of the acoustic parameters.

## ✨ Features

- Processing of monophonic and binaural signals
- Analysis by octave and third-octave bands
- Option to invert the room impulse response before filtering (Kirkeby method)
- Smoothing through various methods (Schroeder, Moving Median Filter)
- Downloading of data on calculated parameters in .csv file
